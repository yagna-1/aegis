# Aegis v2

> Stop putting API keys where AI agents can read them.

A lightweight credential proxy for AI agent workflows. Sits between your agent and any API — injecting real secrets at the network boundary. The agent **never sees credentials**.

Works natively as an MCP server with **Cursor**, **Claude Desktop**, **VS Code / Cline**, and **Windsurf**.

---

## The problem

```
Agent context / system prompt:
  GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_abc123   ← agent can read this
  STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_...  ← one prompt injection and it's gone
```

## The fix

```
Agent  ──►  http://localhost:8080  ──►  Aegis  ──►  api.github.com
              (no key visible)              │
                                           └── pulls GITHUB_TOKEN from Infisical
                                               at request time, never stored locally
```

---

## Quickstart (5 minutes)

### 1. Install Aegis
```bash
go install github.com/yagna-1/aegis/cmd/aegis@latest
```

### 2. Scaffold your project
```bash
cd ~/projects/my-agent
aegis init -services github,slack,stripe
```

### 3. Connect to Infisical (free, open source)
```bash
# Sign up free at https://app.infisical.com
# Create a Machine Identity with Universal Auth
# (Guide: https://infisical.com/docs/documentation/platform/identities/universal-auth)

aegis infisical setup
# → stores Client ID + Secret in your OS keychain
# → your actual API secrets stay in Infisical, never on disk
```

### 4. Add the Infisical block to aegis.yaml
```yaml
infisical:
  project_id: your-project-id
  environment: dev
```

### 5. Add your real secrets to Infisical
In the Infisical dashboard, add `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, etc.

### 6. Start and verify
```bash
aegis status   # checks connection + shows which secrets are found
aegis          # start proxy on :8080
```

## How secrets flow

```
Infisical dashboard
  → stores GITHUB_TOKEN, STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, etc.
  → your actual secrets never touch your machine's filesystem

aegis infisical setup
  → stores only the Machine Identity credentials in OS keychain
  → two values: Client ID (not secret) + Client Secret

aegis starts
  → authenticates with Infisical API using Machine Identity
  → fetches all secrets into process memory
  → auto-refreshes every 5 minutes (rotated secrets propagate automatically)

Agent calls http://localhost:8080
  → Aegis injects the real credential header
  → forwards to allowlisted domain
  → agent sees the API response, never the key
```

---

## Per-project isolation

Aegis auto-discovers `aegis.yaml` by walking up from the working directory — like `.git`:

```
~/projects/
  stripe-app/
    aegis.yaml   ← infisical.environment: prod, allowlist: api.stripe.com only
  github-bot/
    aegis.yaml   ← infisical.environment: dev, allowlist: api.github.com only
```

MCP mode inherits the IDE's working directory. Open a different project → different Infisical environment → different secrets. **No flags needed.**

---

## Secret priority order

| Source | How | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| **Infisical** | `infisical:` block in aegis.yaml | Recommended — team-friendly, rotatable |
| **OS Keychain** | `${keychain:name}` in templates | Good for solo devs, no external service |
| **.env file** | Auto-discovered in project root | Simple fallback, never commit to git |

---

## IDE integration (MCP mode)

One config, works for all projects (auto-discovers per-project aegis.yaml).

**Claude Desktop** — `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aegis": { "command": "aegis", "args": ["-mode", "mcp"] }
  }
}
```

**Cursor** — `.cursor/mcp.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aegis": { "command": "aegis", "args": ["-mode", "mcp"] }
  }
}
```

**VS Code / Cline / Windsurf** — same pattern, check your tool's MCP config path.

The IDE spawns `aegis -mode mcp` as a child process automatically. The agent calls the `http_request` tool — no auth headers, no secrets in context.

---

## Proxy mode — any language

```bash
# .env or system prompt instruction for the agent:
# "Call http://localhost:8080 with header X-Aegis-Target set to the full URL"

curl http://localhost:8080 \
  -H "X-Aegis-Target: https://api.github.com/user/repos"
```

Works with Python, TypeScript, Go, Ruby — any HTTP client.

---

## `aegis status`

```
Config:  /projects/my-agent/aegis.yaml
Port:    8080

Secrets: Infisical
  Site:    https://app.infisical.com
  Project: abc123
  Env:     dev
  Status:  ✓ connected, 8 secrets available

Allowlist (5 domains):
  • api.github.com
  • api.stripe.com
  • slack.com

Credentials (3 configured):
  • api.github.com     Authorization: ✓ loaded
  • api.stripe.com     Authorization: ✓ loaded
  • slack.com          Authorization: ✓ loaded
```

---

## Security model

| Threat | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Agent reads secrets from context | Secrets in Infisical — never in agent context or disk |
| Agent exfiltrates credential via API | Domain allowlist — 403 for anything not listed |
| Agent sets its own auth header (MCP) | Explicitly rejected with error |
| Runaway agent burns API credits | Per-domain rate limit — configurable 429 |
| Prompt injection causes looping | Loop detection + X-Aegis-Warning header |
| Audit trail | NDJSON log — every request recorded, values never logged |
| Secret rotation | Infisical secrets refresh every 5 min — rotations propagate automatically |

---

## Self-hosting Infisical

Infisical is MIT-licensed and fully self-hostable. Point Aegis at your own instance:

```yaml
infisical:
  site_url: https://secrets.your-company.com
  project_id: your-project-id
  environment: dev
```

No data ever leaves your infrastructure.
